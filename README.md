# Hackthisfall2.0
This repository contains the project idea that our team has built during the hackathon.
# Problem Statement
In most of the Indian homes, they use motor to transfer water
from ground well to tank above the roof.
<br>
Due to not knowing how much water is still left to be
transferred in the tank, most of the times water overflows and
gets wasted.
<br>
In times of water crisis and where many countries donâ€™t even
get pure water daily, we must take some approach to save the
overflow of water.
<br>
# An approch using circuit
One of the approaches towards this probelm is to
use an alarm.
<br>
In this approach Alarm is sounded and someone
could just switch off the motor
<br>
Now the question arises, when should be the
alarm sounded and on what basis its sounded?
<br>
# Working of Alarm
There are two wires in the alarm circuit, which are not connected initially and are
in air.
<br>
Since they are in air, no current passes through them.
<br>
When will the current pass?
<br>
Current will pass when there comes in between the wires something that conducts
electricity.
<br>
One of the material is water. So when water reaches a certain level in the tank, the
circuit is closed and alarm is sounded.
<br>
In this way one can stop the water form leakage/overflow.
